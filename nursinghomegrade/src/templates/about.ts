    <h2 style="margin-bottom:0.75rem;">Why we built this</h2>
    <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">
      The dominant nursing home referral services earn commissions from the facilities they recommend —
      as much as $3,500 per family placed. In May 2024, the Washington Post and a Senate investigation
      documented how this creates incentives to hide violation records.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:2rem;">
      NursingHomeGrade takes no commissions. We surface the same CMS data that's publicly available,
      organized and scored in a way that's actually useful.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin-bottom:0.75rem;">How we grade facilities</h2>
    <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">The NursingHomeGrade Score (0–100) is a weighted composite of four CMS data points:</p>
    <ul style="margin-left:1.5rem;margin-bottom:2rem;">
      <li><strong>Staffing compliance (35%):</strong> RN hours per resident per day vs. the 2024 federal minimum of 0.55 hours</li>
      <li><strong>Inspection clean rate (30%):</strong> Total health inspection deficiencies and their severity</li>
      <li><strong>Quality measures (20%):</strong> CMS quality star rating</li>
      <li><strong>Staffing consistency (15%):</strong> CMS staffing star rating</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin-bottom:0.75rem;">Data source</h2>
    <p style="margin-bottom:2rem;">
      All data comes from <a href="https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/topics/nursing-homes">CMS Nursing Home Compare</a>,
      a public dataset updated monthly by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services.
      We apply no editorial adjustments.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin-bottom:0.75rem;">Business model</h2>
    <p>
      We display contextual advertising and earn small referral fees when users click through to
      comparison services. We never receive payments from nursing facilities. If that ever changes,
      we'll disclose it prominently.
